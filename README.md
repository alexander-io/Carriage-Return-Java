# CarriageReturn.java
This project is meant to demonstrate examples of the carriage return '\r' in Java.

This class currently contains a method slashLoader(int numLines).
The slashLoader() method loops over an array of 8 characters and prints them in a carriage return line feed.
> {"|", "/", "—", "\\", "|", "/", "—", "\\"};
